# Module 10 | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Challenge | SVG Logo Maker Generator

## Finished Product

### [ðŸ”—Project Link]() 
When run with "node index.js" the program prompts the user for a shape, color, 3 letter text, and text color before creating a new .svg file in the examples folder. 
If the user enters "npm test" the program will run a test to see if the projected outcome matches the expectation.

This project was developed using the following skills: JS, Node.js, Express,js

All code is neatly commented for clarity's sake.

All code written manually by Tyler Fruik.
